# Waste Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on waste classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python with the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. The model is trained to distinguish between different types of waste, such as organic and recyclable materials.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **[Data Preparation](#1-data-preparation):** Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
2. **[Exploratory Data Analysis](#2-exploratory-data-analysis):** Analyzing and visualizing dataset characteristics.
3. **[Model Architecture](#3-model-architecture):** Defining the CNN model for waste classification.
4. **[Data Augmentation](#4-data-augmentation):** Implementing data augmentation for improved model generalization.
5. **[Model Training](#5-model-training):** Training the waste classification model on GPU.
6. **[Model Evaluation](#6-model-evaluation):** Evaluating the trained model on validation data.
7. **[Model Prediction](#7-model-prediction):** Making predictions on unseen data.

## How to Use

To run the code and train the waste classification model, follow these steps:

1. Open the provided Google Colab notebook in your Google Drive.
2. Run each code cell in the notebook sequentially.
3. Monitor the training process and evaluate the model's performance.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the required Python packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
